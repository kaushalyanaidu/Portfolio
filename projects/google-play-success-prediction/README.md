# 🎯 Google Play Store App Success Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning solution analyzing 2.3M+ apps to predict app success, user churn, and removal risks on the Google Play Store platform.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the success of mobile applications on the Google Play Store. By processing data from over 2.3 million apps, we provide insights into factors affecting app installations, ratings, user retention, and potential removal risks.

### Key Achievements
- 📈 96.6% accuracy in app success prediction using Logistic Regression
- 🎯 97% accuracy in user churn prediction with Random Forest
- 📊 App segmentation using K-Means clustering (Silhouette Score: 0.65)

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle (Google Play Store)
- **Size**: 2.3M+ applications
- **Features**:
  - App ratings and number of installations
  - Category and content rating
  - Pricing information
  - Ad support status
  - In-app purchase options
  - User engagement metrics
  - App removal status

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- Missing value imputation for ratings and pricing
- Categorical variable encoding
- Feature engineering and scaling
- One-hot encoding for categorical features

### Machine Learning Models

#### 1. Logistic Regression (Success Prediction)
- **Accuracy**: 96.6%
- **Key Features**: Rating, Installations, Pricing, Ad Support
- **Use Case**: Predicting app success probability

#### 2. Random Forest Classifier (Churn Prediction)
- **Accuracy**: 97%
- **Features**: User ratings, ad support, update frequency
- **Use Case**: Predicting user churn probability

#### 3. K-Means Clustering (App Segmentation)
- **Clusters**: 6 distinct segments
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.65
- **Use Case**: Strategic app categorization and targeting

## 💡 Key Business Insights

### Success Factors
1. **Ratings**: Apps with 4.0+ ratings show significantly higher success rates
2. **Monetization**: Freemium model outperforms paid apps in long-term success
3. **User Retention**: Regular updates strongly correlate with user retention
4. **Category Impact**: Finance and Gaming apps require stricter quality control

### Recommendations
- **For Developers**:
  - Focus on user experience optimization
  - Implement strategic ad placement
  - Maintain regular update schedule
  
- **For App Stores**:
